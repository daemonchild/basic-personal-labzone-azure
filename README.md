# Basic Personal Labzone Azure
Builds a basic personal cloud lab zone. Creates some stuff that we need for future terraform builds. 

These resources are supposed to be long term, while the projects built on them come and go. Pets, to the project cattle.

You should read the documentation when I've written it.
